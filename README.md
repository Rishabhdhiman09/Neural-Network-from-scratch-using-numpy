# Neural-Network-from-scratch-using-numpy

Well, If you are new to neural networks, you are implementing ANN (Artificial Neural Network) using Keras, Tensorflow etc. Though you get better results with neural network as compare to conventional machine learning algorithms. If you don't understand the maths that's working behind neural network, it's a kind of Black Box (that takes some input and gives you output but you don't know how). The main motive of this Notebook is make you understand how things are working behind the scene.
